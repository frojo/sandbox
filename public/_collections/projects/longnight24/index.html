<p>this moon i tried to start working on a Twitch extension for streaming older Pokemon games. (kind of like Hearthstone Deck Tracker but for pokemon)</p>
<p>the ideas was to get a barebones proof-of-concept version. i didn't really get there... but here's some repos of code :)</p>
<p>frontend: <a href="https://github.com/frojo/longnight24-frontend">https://github.com/frojo/longnight24-frontend</a></p>
<p>backend: <a href="https://github.com/frojo/longnight24-ebs">https://github.com/frojo/longnight24-ebs</a></p>
<p>lua script(s) for the emulator: <a href="https://github.com/frojo/longnight24-lua">https://github.com/frojo/longnight24-lua</a></p>
